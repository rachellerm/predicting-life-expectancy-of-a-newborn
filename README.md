# Predicting the Life Expectancy of a Newborn

## Overview
The objective of this project was to use a regression approach to predict the life expectancy of a newborn based on several attributes related to the region in which he/she was born. Explicitly performing feature selection was restricted. I built, trained, tuned and analysed various regression models such as multivariate linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression and lasso regression. I provided an ultimate judgement of the ﬁnal trained model that I would use in a real-world setting. Finally, the "best" model was used to predict the life expectancy of a newborn on unseen test data.

## Data Source
The original data has been sourced from "Global Health Observatory data repository". The train.csv and test.csv files have been modified slightly by RMIT. The dependent (target) variable ``TARGET_LifeExpectancy`` has been removed from the test set [1].
